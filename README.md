# Spa-Application-Service-Planning

DESCRIPTION : 
                I have developed an application tailored for scheduling spa services and amenities, covering appointment scheduling, various payment options, home service requests, and the ability to choose multiple treatments. Spas provide an extensive range of services, including body treatments, facials, manicures, pedicures, massages, and cosmetic treatments. Additionally, the spa facilities include a swimming pool, sauna, gym, as well as modern locker rooms equipped with showers, changing areas, lockers, and restrooms.Through this application, customers can save time by pre-booking their desired services and even opt for in-home treatments, thus avoiding long waiting times. This also assists spa owners and managers in efficient planning, as they can monitor company performance, manage inventory, improve time management, and engage with new clients.The chosen application environment is either Salesforce or ServiceNow, aimed at simplifying the scheduling process for customers, ensuring availability during their preferred times. Furthermore, the application serves as an informative hub, consolidating all spa offerings in one place for easy access by both staff and clients. Overall, this project yields significant benefits by reducing effort for employees and customers alike, streamlining operations, and enhancing the overall spa experience.
